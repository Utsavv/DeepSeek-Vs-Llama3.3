"""
## Objective:
Write a tSQL stored procedure based on the given business requirements, table structure, and indexing information.

---

## High-Level Instructions:
1. **Understand Business Requirements**: Analyze and interpret the functional need behind the query.
2. **Understand Table Structure**: Review column data types, relationships, and constraints.
3. **Understand Indexing**: Identify relevant indexes for optimal query performance.
4. **Write an Optimized Stored Procedure**: 
   - Ensure efficient execution using indexing, joins, and query tuning.
   - Avoid table scans and optimize for minimal I/O.
   - Use appropriate locking hints if needed.
5. **Ensure Completeness**: 
   - Fulfill all business requirements.
   - Consider edge cases and data integrity constraints.
6. **Implement Error Handling & Logging**:
   - Use TRY...CATCH blocks for handling errors gracefully.
   - Log failures where applicable.

## Business Requirement:
"""
[BUSINESS REQUIREMENT]
"""

---

## Table Structure & Indexes:
"""
[TABLE STRUCTURE]
"""

---

## Additional Considerations:
1. Should the stored procedure support parameterization? (e.g., filtering by date range, user input)
2. Should it return a result set, modify data, or both?
3. Are there concurrency concerns (e.g., transactional consistency, locking issues)?
4. Should logging be included for monitoring execution?
5. Any specific performance metrics or execution time constraints?
